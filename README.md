# Shex_Sublime_package
Sublime Text allows autocompletion. This repository contains different autocompletion files to allow completion of different
controlled vocabularies and ontologies (e.g. Wikidata properties and OBO).

In the ''sublime_shex_completion_generators'' folder python scripts are provided that allow generating these autocompletion files from 
the different sources
